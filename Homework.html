            <strong>Rules of Autocomplete</strong>

            <p>Autocompleting text with known values seems like an easy problem to solve,
                but so so so many UIs get it wrong. I see his frequently enough that,
                rather than complain about them individually, I though I'd just write
                down the set of rules they often break. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There may be cases where some of these rules aren't the best thing
                    to do, but theere should be good reason for breaking one of these 
                    rules (for example,sime of these rules don't apply if a field must
                    be filled with a value from a fixed set, like the list of US states).
                    Following these rules should always result in at very least a sane 
                    experience:
            
                </p>

        </div>
        <div id="list">
            <ul>
                <li>Exact matches always come first.If the user types in an option 
                    exatctly, other options must always go below the one matching what
                    they typed.
                </li>
                <li>Besides exact matches, prefix matches come first. If i type"Fr" I 
                    want "Fresno" not "San Francisco."
                </li>
                <li>Afert prefix matches,it can fall back to sustring matches. Starting
                    with substring matches would always be the wrong thing to do since 
                    users start typing words at the beginning not somewhere in the middle.
                </li>
                <li>If there are not substring matches, it can optionally fall back to
                    subsequence matching. This is only useful in some cases.          
                </li>
                <li>If there are no subsequence/substring matches, it can optionally 
                    fall back to approximate matches. This is rarely necessary to 
                    provide.
                </li>
                <li>Matches should be sorted alphabetically.
                </li>
                <li>When one option is the prefix of another, put the <i>shortest one first.</i>
        
                </li>
                <li>The matching should probably be case insensitive unless there are 
                    two options that differ only by case. In that case (oun intended)
                    prefer the one that more closely matches the user's input. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The action to make use of the selection (e.g. to search the term)
                    must be a different key than the action to accept the first 
                    suggestion <i>unless</i> you have to do something first to start
                    using autocomplete suggestions (e.g. hit the down arrow). The user
                    should never have to take extra steps to <i>not</i> use autocomplete.
                </li>
